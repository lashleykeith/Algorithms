# Algorithms
This is a repo is for Algorithms in different languages.  
The goal of this project is simply to provide a source where engineers can compare the Golang and Python can be be used to solve the same problems.
When we progress enough in comparing Golang to Python I also want to begin including other languaages such as Ruby, and Java into this.
